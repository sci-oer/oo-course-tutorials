    "There are two ways to ensure that resources are properly closed.  One is to use a `finally` block in conjunction with the try/catch.  Modify the code shown below so that it opens a file, reads and prints all of the lines in the file, and then closes the file in the finally block.  You'll have to upload the file to the directory so that the REPL can find it.\n"
